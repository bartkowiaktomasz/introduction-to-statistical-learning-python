Suppose that we have $K$ classes, and that if an observation belongs to the kth class then $X$ comes from a one-dimensional normal distribution, $X \\sim N(\\mu_k, \\sigma_k^2)$. Recall that the density function for the one-dimensional normal distribution is given in (4.11). Prove that in this case, the Bayes’ classifier is not linear. Argue that it is in fact quadratic.\n",

When the number of features `p` is large, there tends to be a deterioration in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test observation for which a prediction must be made.

This phenomenon can be observed for wide variety of distance metrics, but it is more pronounced for the Euclidean metric than, say, Manhattan distance metric.
